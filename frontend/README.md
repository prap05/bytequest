# Problem Statement

Fintech track:

PS 13: Investing for Everyone -
A large portion of India’s population—especially first-time users from rural, semi-urban, and low-income communities—remains excluded from formal investing due to fear, lack of financial literacy, distrust in financial applications, limited internet access, and the belief that investing requires large amounts of money.  
As a result, many people rely only on cash savings, missing opportunities for safe and long-term wealth creation.
